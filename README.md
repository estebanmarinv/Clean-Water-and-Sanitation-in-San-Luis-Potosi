# WORLD-UNDP

One of the most important issues in any city of the world is having enough water to sustain its population
and needs. The United Nations Development Program has set the importance of Clean Water and Sanitation
as Goal Number Six from the Seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to “protect the planet and
ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030”. The urgency for not running out of water is a fundamental part for most local governments worldwide. Taking action by ourselves and not only expecting
others to do what must be done is the reason I decided to apply for this in field research in my hometown, San Luis Potosi (SLP), Mexico.

For the purposes of this research I contacted the local authorities of SLP and worked in coordination with
the water supply agency INTERAPAS. Thanks to the support given by the WORLD Analysis Policy Center and the Hilton Foundation I diced to hire three research assistants (Mauricio Gonzalez, Pablo Narvaez, and Bernardo Villagomez) with the financial resources originally provided. Fortunately, I did not need the full scholarship for rent due to the fact that I own a small house in the city, so I decided to rent a small space and use it as an office. This freedom of choosing my team gave me the opportunity to work with full autonomy and focus the research in providing the INTERAPAS solutions to its problems without any political interference, which I’m totally grateful.
